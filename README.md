### Hi! 🖥

😀 My name is **Devam Mondal**, and I'm a high school sophomore at Edison High School.

🏫 I attend the STEM Academy, and love engineering solutions to large-scale problems.

🤖 I am currently the head programmer of **Team Faraday**, the Edison High School FTC team, working with Java. 

📈 📱 I am also interested in data science and mobile development.

Feel free to check out any of my repositories!
