### What's poppin'?

My name is Devam Mondal, and I'm a junior at Edison High.
I'm the head programmer of FTC Team 18671 (Faraday).
I'm experienced in Java and Python, and I know Javascript and web scripting languages.
I'm interested in **mobile app development**, **ML/neural networks**, and **robotics**. 

Some of my key projects include:
* Handwriting Recog: A neural network built from scratch using linear algebra and NumPy that can process human handwriting.
* GetItDone: An intuitive to-do list built using React-Native that makes organization easy.

I have a bunch of other projects, so check out my Github!
