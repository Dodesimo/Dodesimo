## About me

My name is Devam! I'm a student studying computer science at Georgia Tech interested in software engineering! I've interned as a AI Engineering Intern @ YC-startup InPharmD, and am currently interning at Cisco on the Email Threat Defense team. I'll be joining Millennium Management this summer as an intern on the Latency Critical Trading team.

I'm experience in backend and full-stack development, as well as AI engineering. I'm especially curious about low-latency development and AI infra.
