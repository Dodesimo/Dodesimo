### Hi!

I'm Devam, and I'm interested in natural language processing, machine learning, and robotics. 

Currently, I'm the captain and head programmer for FTC Team 18671, as well as a CS + Linguistics intern at Stevens Institute of Technology's Center for Complex Systems and Enterprises, working with Professor Carlo Lipizzi. I was also a Machine Learning and Data Science intern at whiz.ai 2023 summer, and will be an incoming R&D intern this November, and a ML engineer this coming Summer. 

Feel free to reach out to me: devammondal06@gmail.com
