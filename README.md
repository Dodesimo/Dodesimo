### Hi!

I'm Devam, and I'm interested in natural language processing, machine learning, and data science. I'm an incoming freshman at Georgia Tech majoring in computer science.  

Currently, I am ...
* working under Professor Carlo Lipizzi at the Center for Complex Systems and Enterprises @ Stevens Institute of Technology on methods to debias large-langauge models and quantify bias (paper out on arxiv!).

Feel free to reach out to me at devammondal06@gmail.com.
